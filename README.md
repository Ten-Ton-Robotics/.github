# Ten Ton Robotics

We are Ten Ton Robotics, and welcome to our GitHub organization!

We are a district-wide academy in West Vancouver, School District #45. We believe that students should learn through their own experiences, not a mentor or coach telling them what to do. We provide them with tools, resources, and guidance to enable them to build robots which compete in [VEX IQ Competition](https://recf.org/vex-iq-robotics-competition/) (VIQRC), [Vex Robotics Competition](https://recf.org/vex-robotics-competition/) (VRC), [VEX U College and University](https://recf.org/teams/vex-u/) (VEXU) [Bell Advanced Vertical Robotics Competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihNsvldYPQM) (AVR), [RoboSub Competition](https://robosub.org/), and the [First Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) (FRC).

## This GitHub Organization

This organization is primarily for use by our FRC teams. Repositories for every FRC season will be made available here as a public archive once the season is complete. We use GitHub because of its team-management features, allowing for tight integration with our projects all in the same place. It also allows us to control access to our projects as well.
